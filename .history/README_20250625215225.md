# 📩 SMS Spam Classifier

A **machine learning-based web app** that classifies text messages as **SPAM** or **HAM** using Natural Language Processing and scikit-learn.  
🔧 Built by **Pal Patel** as part of an AI Internship submission.

## 💡 Project Overview

This project is a complete end-to-end implementation of a **Spam Detection System** that:

- Cleans and processes SMS messages
- Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF**
- Uses **Naive Bayes** for classification
- Presents a beautiful, responsive **Streamlit GUI**

The app predicts whether a user-entered message is **Spam** or **Ham** (not spam).
